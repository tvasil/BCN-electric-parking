# BCN-traffic-accidents
EDA and data visualization project, showing concentration of traffic accidents in Barcelona (2017) <br>
The project is based off the data published on the [Barcelona Open Data portal](http://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/accidents-gu-bcn).

<ul><li>As a former resident of Barcelona, I was always interested in traffic accident prevention, especially where pedestrians are involved. 
  <li> Looking at the distribution of accidents from 2017 on a map, we can see that the majority of accidents are between 2 cars, minor, no pedestrians are involved and they happen during lunch time (presumably rush hour for deliveries and otherwise road traffic.</ul>
